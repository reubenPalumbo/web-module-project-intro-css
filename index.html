    Just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, 
    the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.
  </p>
  <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, 
    but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, 
    ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

  Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. 
  This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <span>current fire restrictions.</span>
